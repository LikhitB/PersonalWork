- Process of VPC peering

  - lets consider 3 VPC(marketing,finance,developer) which have 3 instances in them so we need to peer marketing and developer with finance
  - each VPC has one subnet and finance has private subnet
  - security groups which are not configured
  - process
    - lets consider first marketing,finaance connection
      - first we check by pinging finanace instance through marketing session manager
      - we get nothing as VPC is private
      - So now we go to peering connection in VPC and add
        - VPC ID of requester
        - VPC ID of accepter
        - CIDR(classless internet domain routing) -> it must be different for both of them
          - example 10.10.0.0/16 is for marketing , 172.31.0.0/16 is for finance
      - after setting up the peering and accepting that peering connection
      - its time to add rules in the routing tables of instance in each subnets
        - the rule must us "peering connection" 
      - now if we chek in session manager of marketing instance still finance doest responds
      - so the solution is add inbound rule to the finance security groups i.e allow ICMP(internet control message protocol) traffic from marketing           instance 
   - now we successfully connected the VPC same repeats for developer.
