Creation Autoscaling Groups

we need an instance in a subnet of a default or created VPC 
ASG is depended on Launch template 
A launch template needs AMI so first create first AMI then launch template and finally ASG
AS uses launch template as a refernce to create an instance
launch template should in same VPC and use same security groups as AMI 
An ASG has scheduling policy we can schedule the creation or deletion of instance.
