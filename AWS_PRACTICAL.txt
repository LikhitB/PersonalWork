ASSIGINING ROLE TO A USER IN AWS
==================================
Definition:An IAM Role is an AWS identity that defines a set of permissions, but unlike an IAM user, it does not have long‑term credentials. Instead, it is assumed by trusted entities — such as EC2 instances, Lambda functions, ECS tasks, or even external users via identity federation. When the role is assumed, AWS issues temporary security credentials that expire automatically.

-login to root account create a role in account mode(there will some modes like service etcc..)
-create policy for that role ex:-s3FullAccess
-now login to the user account 
-add the arn:: link of the role in the inline policy of the user and set the principal as sts::assumeRole.
-now relogin to the root account and copy the arn::link to switch role.
-logout from root and relogin to user account and paste the arn link -> enter -> windows pops to switch role and BOOM the user is now on the created role.
-Trusted Policy -> shows who can take this role
 example- its for resource mode
